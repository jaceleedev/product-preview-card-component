## My process

### Built with

- Next.js (v14.2.5)
- TypeScript (v5)
- Tailwind CSS (v3.4.1)
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid, Flexbox
- SEO & web accessibility

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I gained valuable insights and improved my skills in several areas:

1. Responsive Design: I discovered that combining both grid and flexbox is incredibly powerful for creating responsive layouts. This approach provides a versatile toolkit for addressing various design challenges across different screen sizes.

2. Desktop-first vs Mobile-first Approach: While I'm aware that the mobile-first approach is currently trendy, I found the desktop-first approach more intuitive when working on responsive designs. However, I recognize the need to gain more experience with the mobile-first approach in future projects. This will help me better understand the pros and cons of each method and determine which is more suitable for different scenarios.

These learnings have not only improved my technical skills but also given me a clearer direction for future growth and areas to focus on in upcoming projects.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on and improving in these areas:

1. Exploring the Mobile-First Approach: I plan to implement the mobile-first approach to gain hands-on experience. By doing so, I aim to understand the strengths and weaknesses of both mobile-first and desktop-first methodologies. This practical experience will be invaluable in helping me determine the most appropriate approach for different project scenarios.

By focusing on these areas, I hope to continually improve my front-end development skills and create more efficient and sophisticated web applications.
